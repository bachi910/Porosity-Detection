# Porosity-Detection
- Visualize thermal porosity characterization data of Additively Manufactured Ti–6Al–4V Thin-walled Structure
via Laser Engineered Net Shaping.
- Perform feature extraction using a pre-trained VGG16 model to extract meaningful features from the images
after conversion from CSV
- Train machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost) to detect the presence of porosity and
estimate porosity size.
- Conduct a Random Search hyperparameter search to optimize the performance of the machine learning models.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the trained models in accurately detecting porosity and estimating porosity size in
the manufactured structures.
- Provide insights into the potential applications of machine learning models for thermal porosity characterization
in additive manufacturing processes.
- Contribute to the advancement of quality control and defect detection methodologies in additive manufacturing
industries.
